<h3>V for Vendetta</h3>
<p>Featuring Hugo Weaving and simply one of the best perfonces by Natalie Portman, V for Vendetta, a dystopian political action film that points to the curruption of mankind an the role goverment plays for every society with its habitants as pawns. In this movie, it's its narrative that envolves you through a definetly poetic argument while forces you to reject everything you know and open your eyes to all what's wrong with the world.</p>
